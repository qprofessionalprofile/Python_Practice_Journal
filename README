--- Python Practice Folder ---

This repository is my ongoing, living journal of python pracice.
I update it regularly with exccercises,  notes, and mini projects that 
explore python fundamentals and beyond. 

--- It's Purpose ---

This is not jsut code - Its proof of my consistent Python Practice.
Here, I experiment with:
-Strings and string manipulation, including string theory concepts in python.
-Lists, dictionaries, Tuples, and nested structures. 
- Control flow and Functions
= File Handling 
- Random small projects that grow naturally from pracice sessions


I regularly go back to old lessons to improve formatting, reorganize code, and make comments easier to understand.
I also try and keep each block of code that shows what im learning seperated by 2-3 lines for better readability.
