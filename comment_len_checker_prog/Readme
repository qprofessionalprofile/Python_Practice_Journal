This Python program helps the user stay in pep-8 styling range. 

Its taught me the importance of being clear & concise in my comments and gave me more practice using f-strings and conditionals.

It features:
- Taking a comment string.
- Checks the length of the comment.
- Warns if the comment is too long.
- Suggests using a multi line comment if needed.

The program stores the comments in a variable. Then uses Pythons built in len() function to check the length.
An if statement compare the length against the safe range 78-80 characters and prints letting you know if-
the comment is too long or or just right.


Future plans:
- Add a user input prompt so you can type/paste a comment directly into the console.
- The program will check the length automatically after you hit enter.
- implement a loop so after one comment is checked, it'll ask if you want to check another.
- Making it much easier to copy/pasting comments.
